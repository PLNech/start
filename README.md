# Getting Started with the Speechgrinder API

This repository features a set of simple code examples on how to use the Speechgrinder API with a few of the most popular progarmming languages. The language specific examples can be found in respective subdirectories of this repository. 

The Speechgrinder API is defined using protocol buffers (see [sg.proto](sg.proto)). If your favorite programming language is not included in our examples you can generate your own client by following the instructions from [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).  

To get started apply for an application id for our beta program by sending an email to [appid@speechgrinder.com](mailto:appid@speechgrinder.com). There are limited seats! Happy hacking!
