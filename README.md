# Getting Started with the Speechgrinder API

This repository features a set of simple code examples on how call the Speechgrinder API with a few of the most popular programming languages. The language specific examples can be found in respective subdirectories of this repository.

The Speechgrinder API is defined using protocol buffers (see [sg.proto](sg.proto)). If your favorite programming language is not included in our examples you can generate your own client by following the instructions from [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

To get an application id apply to our beta program by sending an email to [appid@speechgrinder.com](mailto:appid@speechgrinder.com). There are limited seats! Happy hacking!

### Next Steps

After you've gotten yourself started with the code in this repo you can check out [the grocery repository](https://github.com/speechgrinder/grocery) for a more complete example using the Speechgrinder API.
