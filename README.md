# Getting Started with the Speechly API

This repository features simple code examples on how to call the [Speechly](https://www.speechly.com/) API with Python and Node. The language specific examples can be found in respective subdirectories of this repository.

The Speechly API is defined using protocol buffers (see [sg.proto](sg.proto)). If your favorite programming language is not included in our examples you can generate your own client by following the instructions from [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).

To get an application id apply to our beta program by sending an email to [appid@speechly.com](mailto:appid@speechky.com). There are limited seats! Happy hacking!

You can read more about Speechly at [our website](https://www.speechly.com/).
